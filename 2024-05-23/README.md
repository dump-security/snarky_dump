The patent US11611582B2 has bestowed upon us a computer-implemented method that uses a pre-defined statistical model to detect phishing threats. Because, you know, phishing is such a novel concept that we've never thought to guard against it before.

This method, a dazzling spectacle of machine learning wizardry, dynamically analyzes network requests in real-time. It's not just any analysis, though—it's proactive! That means it actually tries to stop phishing attacks before they happen, unlike those other lazy methods that just sit around waiting for disaster to strike.

When a network request graciously makes its way to our system, it must first reveal its secrets—things like the fully qualified domain name, the domain's age (because older domains clearly have more wisdom), the domain registrar, IP address, and even its geographic location. Because obviously, geographic location is crucial. Everyone knows that phishing attacks from scenic locations are less suspicious.

These juicy details are then fed to the ever-hungry, pre-trained statistical model, which, in its infinite wisdom, calculates a probability score. This score, a beacon of numerical judgment, tells us the likelihood that this humble network request is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing, a.k.a. a phishing threat.
And should this score dare exceed the sanctity of our pre-defined threshold—an arbitrary line in the cyber sand—an alert is generated. Because nothing says "I'm on top of things" like a good old-fashioned alert.

This statistical model isn't some static relic; it's a living, learning creature. It's trained on datasets teeming with known phishing and non-phishing examples and is periodically updated with fresh data to keep up with the ever-evolving fashion trends of phishing attacks.

Truly, we are blessed to have such an innovative tool at our disposal, tirelessly defending our digital realms from the ceaseless onslaught of phishing attempts. What would we do without it? Probably just use common sense, but where's the fun in that?
