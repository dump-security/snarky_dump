# 2024-04-26: Cybersecurity landscape within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region

Unpacking in more detail: see pdf

It was a year when APAC became the belle of the cyberattack ball, accounting for a whopping 31% of global cyberattacks. Imagine, over half of the organizations in the region admit they'd been cyber-attacked. 

The 60% of APAC respondents who lay awake at night, worried about network decryption as the quantum computing security threat of greatest concern. It's the cybersecurity equivalent of worrying about an asteroid hitting the Earth â€“ it's out there, it's scary, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. In a twist that would make any Hollywood scriptwriter proud, only 50% of APAC organizations had a formal ransomware response plan. That's up from 47% in 2022, which is like celebrating that you've finally decided to install a smoke detector after half the neighborhood has burned down.

One can only hope that the region's cybersecurity efforts beef up faster than a bodybuilder on steroids. Otherwise, the cyber threats of 2023 will be remembered for the collective facepalm they induced across the APAC region.
