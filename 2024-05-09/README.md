# 2024-05-09: Patent CN111913833A 

Unpacking in more detail: see pdf

Another blockchain solution to solve all our healthcare woes. Because, you know, what the healthcare industry has been desperately missing is more buzzwords like "dual-blockchain architecture" and "attribute-based encryption." Who wouldn't sleep better knowing their sensitive medical data is bouncing around on not one, but two blockchains? It's like double the security blanket, or double the headache, depending on how you look at it. Let's not forget the pièce de résistance: AI integration. Because nothing says "trustworthy and secure" like throwing artificial intelligence into the mix. 

And then there's the real-time monitoring feature, because constant surveillance is exactly what we all need for peace of mind. Nothing screams "privacy" like having every heartbeat and blood pressure reading recorded on an immutable ledger.

But wait, there's more! The system promises "decentralization," the magical word that apparently solves unauthorized data tampering. Because as we all know, decentralization has made cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin completely immune to fraud and theft. Oh, wait...

In all seriousness, the patent CN111913833A does aim to tackle genuine issues in the healthcare sector, such as data breaches and the lack of standardized protocols for secure data exchange. However, one can't help but approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, if history has taught us anything, it's that technology is only as good as its implementation and the humans behind it. So, here's to hoping that this blockchain-based transaction system for the medical Internet of Things is more than just another buzzword bingo winner.
