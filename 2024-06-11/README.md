Unpacking in more detail: see pdf

Ah, the shadowy world of offensive security private companies, where the line between white hats and black hats is as clear swing state. 

These enterprising companies peddle in the digital dark arts, offering everything from software implants to intrusion sets, and from 0day exploits to security bypassing techniques.

Most of them have been involved in nation-state offensive cyber operations, which is just a fancy way of saying they help governments spy on each other and have turned paranoia into profit, and all it took was a little creativity and a flexible moral compass

So, if you ever feel like your privacy is being respected a little too much, just remember that there's a whole industry out there working tirelessly to ensure that your secrets are as private as a tweet on a billboard. And to all the offensive security private companies out there, we salute you. Without your tireless efforts, the internet would be a much less interesting place
