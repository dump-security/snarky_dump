Unpacking in more detail: see pdf

The scandalous article "Russia seeks to build a fully state-controlled IT ecosystem" is simply overflowing with intrigue, jealousy and envy. How could you even try to create your own digital world, free from the clutches of these annoying Western technologies and services. Especially against the background of the fact that people have begun to worry about data privacy and are already suing the poor giants of Silicon Valley right and left.

And who is the culprit of the celebration - the Vkontakte company, a modest mail service that has turned into a digital conglomerate. "How dare he," the author is outraged, although he only made the lives of his compatriots more comfortable, convenient and safe. 

It is simply incredible how Russia managed to create such an impressive IT ecosystem, leaving other countries in the shadow.  And the courage and audacity to develop a digital ecosystem that includes many services potentially used by every citizen is simply amazing. This ecosystem, designed to help manage information and improve the quality of life of Russians, is something that other countries can only dream of.

The whole article talks about how unpleasant it is for Western countries to see that Russia is reaping the benefits of this IT ecosystem. They have achieved digital sovereignty, expanded their information management capabilities, and even increased their resilience to economic sanctions. Their e-government and payment systems are superior to some Western countries, which leads to increased efficiency of public services and financial transactions.

Therefore, the author notes that it is simply unfair that Russia has managed to use its IT ecosystem in the interests of various industries within the country, such as e-commerce, financial services, telecommunications, media and entertainment, education and healthcare.
